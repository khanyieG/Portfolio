          After the conversation I had with the SovTech team at WeThinkCode_
          Expo,I saw there's no other place that best suited for my growth as a
          junior Software Developer at SovTech. Coming from a peer to peer
          environment at WeThinkCode_ I hope to get the opportunity to one day
          work with a corporate team in the development of a live project and
          gain knowledge and wisdom from the mentors around me.I have the
          potential to be a great software engineer since I am driven and
          enthusiastic about learning new things.I'm eager to join your team and
          add my expertise while learning from the skilled developers at
          SovTech.
